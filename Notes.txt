	Downloaded Greek and Latin data from Perseus Github Repositories
		https://github.com/PerseusDL/canonical

	Put all the relevant Greek or Latin files in one directory
		renamed them something sensible

		mkdir GREEK # or LATIN
		for f in <cloned-greek-perseus-repository>/data/*/*grc*.xml; mv $f DATA/.; done
			# use lat instead of grc for Latin
		python Scripts/Perseus_Title_Author_Extractor.sh GREEK/* # or LATIN

		then I divided GREEK and LATIN into two smaller files and compressed them
			so they were small enough that I could move them to Data/ and upload to Github

	I cloned our AgnosticNER github repository to test it with the new data

		Step 1 in the README will obviously not work well because the MOSES preprocessor doesn't handle Latin or Greek, so we shouldn't run:

		sh Scripts/prepare_original_texts.sh Scripts/preprocess.py $lg 

		but the first command in that Step 1 (python Scripts/preprocess.py <file>) seems to be successfully extracting both Latin and Greek body texts from the xml

			if we find errors with this later, we could try using the beautiful soup package instead

Finished coding the language independent algorithm preTag_deLex
	Seems to work really well but could use some more betaTesting

ToDo:

	UPDATE README 

	MORE RECONSIDERATION OF PRECISION AND RECALL IN SCORING
	CHANGE DEFAULT EVALUATION TO BE ( LIST RECALL + IN-CONTEXT F ) / 2 (also how it's calculated and reported in oracle.py)
	Add functionality to upweight weights so that it's more likely to risk precision errors

	COMBINE THE FINAL LIST AND THE GAZATTEER AT THE END TO MAKE A POTENTIALLY IMPERFECT POTENTIALLY LONGER GAZATTEER

	ALTER PREPROCESSING STEP
		cut off maximize length of sentences at 200
		to preserve features, not just labels, i.e., metadata from the OCR output html or previously existing linguistic analysis

	SCRIPT TO MAP OUTPUT BACK TO ORIGINAL INPUT .TXT OR .XML FILES

	FIX REPORTING OF ACCURACY PREDICTION 

	Custom Eval Bug may still be around, where you have to realign the predictions file by removing an empty first line if youâ€™re unlucky enough to get one
