Downloaded Greek and Latin data from Perseus Github Repositories
	https://github.com/PerseusDL/canonical

Put all the relevant Greek or Latin files in one directory
	renamed them something sensible

	mkdir GREEK # or LATIN
	for f in <cloned-greek-perseus-repository>/data/*/*grc*.xml; mv $f DATA/.; done
		# use lat instead of grc for Latin
	python Scripts/Perseus_Title_Author_Extractor.sh GREEK/* # or LATIN

	then I divided GREEK and LATIN into two smaller files and compressed them
		so they were small enough that I could move them to Data/ and upload to Github
