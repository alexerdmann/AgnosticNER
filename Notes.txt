	Downloaded Greek and Latin data from Perseus Github Repositories
		https://github.com/PerseusDL/canonical

	Put all the relevant Greek or Latin files in one directory
		renamed them something sensible

		mkdir GREEK # or LATIN
		for f in <cloned-greek-perseus-repository>/data/*/*grc*.xml; mv $f DATA/.; done
			# use lat instead of grc for Latin
		python Scripts/Perseus_Title_Author_Extractor.sh GREEK/* # or LATIN

		then I divided GREEK and LATIN into two smaller files and compressed them
			so they were small enough that I could move them to Data/ and upload to Github

	I cloned our AgnosticNER github repository to test it with the new data

		Step 1 in the README will obviously not work well because the MOSES preprocessor doesn't handle Latin or Greek, so we shouldn't run:

		sh Scripts/prepare_original_texts.sh Scripts/preprocess.py $lg 

		but the first command in that Step 1 (python Scripts/preprocess.py <file>) seems to be successfully extracting both Latin and Greek body texts from the xml

			if we find errors with this later, we could try using the beautiful soup package instead
